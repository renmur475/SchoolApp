Project Name: School App
Team Name: Blue
Members: Renee Murray and Christina Carvalho 
We are building an app for students that allows them to easily organize their school life. The app will feature an assignment calendar, note taking and flashcards, and a scientific calculator. As students, we know how easy it is to become disorganized with school. We want to help our fellow students stay organized so they can feel less stressed.
Christina will work on the notes and flashcard portion of the app, while Renee will work on the assignment calendar and calculator. At the end we will work together on implementing different theming for the app. Each of us will dedicate two weeks to our portions, then combine everything into one app. This will allow time to fix any issues that may arise.
